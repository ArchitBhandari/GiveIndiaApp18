What does our App do?
=====================

  This app gives you power to search NGO's given your location from your handheld device without using GPS! Instead we
get your location from the nearest tower. It also gives you ability to refer/recommend NGO's to your friends using
social media tools.
  It also has the ability to view all the people who have been talking about it and the current works the NGO's are
undertaking. 
  The app provides a rating mechanism based on which the NGO's are listed to the users. The different parameters under
consideration are location, the number of people who have been talking about it. Allows you to see NGO's recommended 
by your friends and as to where they have donated to.
